    "The scope of this analysis is to investigate the effects of global economic crisis to international migration in the recent years. Even though the long-term effect may need a few more years before it can be properly studied there is now enough evidence to support a short-term analysis. Two separate datasets will be used to support this analysis:\n",
    "- One from the World Bank [http://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/] that has several indices representing the financial status of a country. These data spans 4 decades and comprises a plethora of indicators that need to be assessed for their relevance.\n",
    "- One from the department of work and pensions [https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/national-insurance-number-registrations-overseas-nationals-borough] which contains data for the NI numbers issued to other nationals over that last few years. UK is used here as a benchmark as it attracts professionals from all over the globe for several reasons.\n",

    "Initial investigation: understand which of the reported attributes are relevant to the analytical questions that we need to answer. There are numerous columns so we may need to see how we can reduce some of those dimensions (perhaps use some correlation technique to identify dependencies within the data). Perhaps gather some additional data to inform distances between the stated countries and the UK as distance might is an independent factor that affects migration regardless of the crisis so it might be beneficial to include in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assess the data quality and ensure that there is enough data in both datasets to cover the period in question. Identify a way to merge the data (i.e. common keys). Because this is timeseries data and we can to measure the effect of a trend we may need to derive increase or decrease over a period. Perhaps also normalise the data based on the population of the different countries to have all data at the same scale.\n",
